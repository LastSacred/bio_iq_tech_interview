To run the application start the server with `rails s` and go to `http://localhost:3000/calculator` in your browser.

In the interest of full disclosure, I did not finish this project in an hour.
In about an hour I had only the Calculator.parse_string method complete
I committed often so you could see my timeline, but there were interruptions due to other appointments.
I estimate it took me about 3 hours total with tests and everything.
